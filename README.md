MatFileRW is a library which allows reading and writing MAT files.  Have a look at [MatIOTest.java](src/test/java/com/jmatio/test/MatIOTest.java?ts=4) to see each part in use.

As far as compatibility, the TL;DR is that it will work with any MAT-File with default settings.  The dirty details are that this library works with `v6` and `v7`, but not `v4` or `v7.3`.

* v4 is the default format before R8
* v6 is the default format from R8 to R13
* v7 is the default format from R14 to present (every R20XXX release)
* MATLAB does not export to v7.3 by default.
* The [Mathworks website](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/mat-file-versions.html?refresh=true) has more details.

## codemercenary/jmatio and ca.mjdsystems.jmatio

Since JMatIO wasn't updated for a while, lots of people made forks.  One of the most prominent was Jason Lokerson's, hosted on GitHub as codemercenary/JMatIO.  It included several improvements, but all the packages were renamed to `ca.mjdsystems.jmatio`.  Starting with 2.0.0, all of the improvements from MatFileRW and `ca.mjdsystems.jmatio` have been merged into the `com.jmatio` packages.

If you are a user of the `ca.mjdsystems` packages, you should download `com.diffplug.matsim:matfilerw:2.0.0.TRANSITION` from mavenCentral.  This contains the `ca.mjdsystems.jmatio` packages unchanged, but marked as deprecated.  After you have removed all dependencies on the `ca.mjdsystems.jmatio` packages, you will be able to use the regular `2.0.0` version, and its descendants.

## Acknowledgements

This project is forked from the JMatIO project originally maintained on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmatio/), and now maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/gradusnikov/jmatio).  The name was changed to ensure that we don't infringe the original project's license, but we did not change the package names, so this project is binary compatible with the original JMatIO.  We are very thankful to Wojciech Gradkowski for creating JMatIO, but this fork is in no way associated with or endorsed by any authors of the original project.

We have fixed some bugs and added some features (see the [changelog](CHANGES.md)), and we will maintain this library into the future.  We're happy to accept [pull requests](CONTRIBUTING.md) too!
